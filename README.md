# Testy

Docs incoming :)

We couldn't find a framework that addressed our API acceptance testing desires, so we're making one ourselves. This
project is still a rapid work in progress, so full details will be added once things start to stabilize a bit and
we're actually using this for tests.

This requires go 1.18 (latest beta or rc preferred, if it isn't fully released by the time you read this) due to using type parameters.
